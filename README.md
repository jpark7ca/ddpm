# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
This is my implementation of diffusion models without classifier guidance using Pokeman image dataset to generate new pokeman characters.

In this example, I have used **Complete Pokemon Image Dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hlrhegemony/pokemon-image-dataset). I think the number of images (2502) is not enough to train a robust Pokeman generator. Check my noteobok and you be the judge. In addition, I have reduced the size of images to 64x64 in order to train the model with Nvidia RTX A2000 (4GB).
